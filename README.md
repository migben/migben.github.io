## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://youtu.be/IPYeCltXpxw?t=16)

I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point. I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

### Custom Domain

If you want to make your new landing page available under a domain like `{username}.com` you can get started here - [Setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
